# Documentation 


Physix.go is a simple, easy-to-use, and fast physics engine written in GoLang. It provides functions to perform physics calculations efficiently, including particle-based physics simulations.

Note : There are some functions for Polygons and all , but they are not good at working , So Please use it like a particle-based physics engine and not for polygons. (Not recommended)

## Installation

So , First of all you need to install [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
